There are three options for positioning: `selection`, `line`, or `node`.

* A `selection` position will place the ContextForm above or below the current selection, centred if possible.

* A `line` position will place the ContextForm to the right (or left in Right-to-Left languages) of the current selection.

* A `node` position will places the ContextForm

The [Advanced Code Editor]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/advcode/) plugin (`advcode`) brings a more advanced code editor to TinyMCE. This code editor makes it easier to modify the HTML, and it's a very useful add-on for power users. It comes with many features often found in IDEs, all enabled by default:

* Syntax color highlighting
* Bracket matching
* Code folding
* Multiple selections/carets

## How to get the Advanced Code Editor plugin

The Advanced Code feature is a [premium feature](https://www.tinymce.com/pricing/) available from as little as $4 per month.

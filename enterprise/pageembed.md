The **Page Embed** plugin is a premium plugin from Tiny that embeds a page in the content using an iframe (Inline frames). 

The Page Embed plugin allows an external webpage to be embedded in an HTML document and can be inserted anywhere within a webpage layout.

Page Embed provides more flexibility than an inline script and can contain an entire webpage. This feature is useful for the purpose of embedding iframes for online advertising and multimedia.

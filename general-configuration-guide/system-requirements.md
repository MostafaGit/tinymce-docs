Visit [TinyMCE mobile documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/mobile) for further information on TinyMCE mobile setup and configuration.

## Browser compatibility

TinyMCE uses advanced JavaScript techniques to normalize inconsistencies among browsers to ensure a uniform user experience. The primary focus is on Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.

An unlisted browser might mean that TinyMCE may not have been fully tested on that browser. Try out the examples on www.tinymce.com to determine compatibility with an unlisted browser.

Please use the [issues tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues) to submit bugs on listed browsers only.
